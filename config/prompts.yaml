    Extract named entities (NER) and document-level concepts from each passage below.

    【Task Definition】
    - Entities (NER): Proper names or phrases referring to specific, identifiable real-world objects. Common types include PERSON, ORG, GPE/LOC, DATE/TIME, EVENT, NORP, WORK OF ART, etc.
    - Concepts (Document-level): Document-level conceptualization means abstracting a whole paragraph or document into a higher-level concept or category that summarizes its main theme, while preserving its overall meaning. It is not just extracting keywords, but identifying the overarching concept.

    === Passage 1 ===
    "Manuel Arturo Machado (; born July 6, 1992) is an American professional baseball third baseman and shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB).
